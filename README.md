## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm JtSpeedRun! Creator of Diego and Saturn Studios and pretty much all of JBE's Videogame stuff. I'm a massive fan of Sonic and other late 90s video games and that really shows in my taste in game creation. I use Gamemaker, unity, Godot, Makecode Arcade, Scratch, and somewhat pico-8. Languages include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS however I'm no pro. I'm always open to collaborating with other coders, just let me know. I work under Saturn studios so I'm not currently looking to join another team full time unless it's just a collab.

### Currently working:

**Sonic Statos | MAKECODE | A sonic game**

**Universal Brawlin' | MAKECODE | A 3.5D sidescrolling fighting game taking characters from accross the Makecode universe and pinning them against eachother in a massive 1V1 Street Fighter-esk experince**

**Diego 3: GT | MAKECODE and GameMaker | A speed based action platformer with new mechanics and charaters to make this the DEFINITIVE Deigo game. In very early development so no more info at this time**
