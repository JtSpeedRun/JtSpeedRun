## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**JtSpeedRun/JtSpeedRun** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I'm JtSpeedRun! Creator of Diego and Saturn Studios and pretty much all of JBE's Videogame stuff. I'm a massive fan of Sonic and other late 90s video games and that really shows in my taste in game creation. I use Gamemaker, unity, Godot, Makecode Arcade, Scratch, and somewhat pico-8. Languages include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS however I'm no pro. I'm always open to collaborating with other coders, just let me know. I work under Saturn studios so I'm not currently looking to join another team full time unless it's just a collab.
Currently working:
Sonic Statos | MAKECODE | A sonic game
Universal Brawlin' | MAKECODE |
Diego 3: GT | MAKECODE and GameMaker |
